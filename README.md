The XRP Cross Border Device
XRP symbol by RobertTheXRPbruce, 
The X, The R, The P, The Waves, The Drops, The Rails, The Cross Borders, 
they are all there in their simplest form and they are on their front foot.

Created with GIMP using preservable text layers and
using text symbols only, ie the letter X and ~ (tilde)
Some examples have anti-aliasing disabled

Sizes 128x128px, 64x64px, 32x32px, 16x16px
Those sizes choosen because that's what everyone else was doing on the master. 
ps, I don't think those sizes are right
